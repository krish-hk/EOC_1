⚙️ <b>C to Binary Translator – </b><br>
This repository contains my implementation of Project 1 from the Elements of Computing Systems (EOC) course, where I built a simple C-to-binary translator for the Hack computer platform.<br>
It takes Hack assembly code and converts it into its corresponding 16-bit binary machine code.<br><br>

🧠 <b>What I did:</b><br>
* Parsed Hack assembly (.asm) instructions<br>
* Handled C-instructions (dest=comp;jump)<br>
* Generated 16-bit binary code according to Hack platform specs<br><br>

📁 <b>What's inside:</b><br>
* Java program<br>
* Sample .asm input files and their .hack binary output<br><br>

📌 <b>Highlights:</b><br>
* Covers basic compiler and translator concepts<br>
* Strengthens understanding of how high-level code gets converted into low-level machine instructions<br><br>

🛠️ <b>Tools:</b><br>
* Java<br>
