⚙️ EOC project 1: C to Binary Translator – This repository contains my implementation of Project 1 from the Elements of Computing Systems (EOC) course, where I built a simple C-to-binary translator for the Hack computer platform. It takes Hack assembly code and converts it into its corresponding 16-bit binary machine code using Java.
